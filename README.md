# DLND-Face_Generation using DC-GAN

This project is part of Udacity DLND. It is a Deep Convelutional Generative Adversarial Network trained on the CelebA dataset to generate new faces. The network is tested on MNIST dataset to generate digits.

## Architecture
text
The architecture used in the original paper was ... 
so I simplified it to be .... and I am still able to generate quite clear face. So, if you got more computation power, you should consider add one more layer to get better result.
